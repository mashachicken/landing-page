        <p> Hello there! Let me tell you a little bit about who
        <strong>I am</strong>. I'm an <em>insighful</em> and
        <em>open minded</em> individual that loves traveling, meeting
        new diverse people, and writing <strong>code</strong>. While I first
        started my career in a sales field, where I couldnt realize my
        interest for <strong>technology</strong>, I quickly discovered my
        passion for coding. I started my path in a coding bootcamp in
        Portland, <strong>Epicodus</strong>. There, I learned to use the best
        programming practises to <strong> build, design, and test</strong>
        applications in <strong>JavaScript & React</strong>, and even
        <strong>Ruby</strong>! With all that
        expirience, I'm now proud to say that I <strong>love</strong> what I
        do, and can utilize my <strong>creativity</strong> in a profession of
        my dreams. I'm now living/self-isolating in <strong>Portland</strong>
        and looking for job opportunities. I hope to chat with you! </p>
